# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 1 July 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learn Node.js from Javascript Teacher Node book. Tbh I already did some of this before so its' more on revisiting the material back and do correction here and there. Most of the code coded are based on the example shown in the book. 
Open a few new tabs regarding server-side material (MDN and The Odin Projects). Will read them later.  
**Thoughts:** Node is awesome, though I'm still not comfortable with it yet. So far the example works just fine, so I will just follow the example and JS Teacher's source code for now. Later, I'll look to do a new project from scratch to test my understanding and grow. Btw, promise. I don't quite grasp it just yet so I will read about it more next time. 

**Link to work:** none
