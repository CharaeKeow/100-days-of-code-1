# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 1 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Continue working on the landing page. Finished the hero section but spending too much time on polishing the hero image (it's a pain lol). Looking to work on the "features" section tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** CSS is a pain in the ass to deal with. Still, I think that I'm doing fine just now. Google sure helps a lot. It's hard but the joy when you finally managed to figure it out is pure delight!

### Round 2.
### Day 1: Nov 20 2018

**Today's Progress**: Nearly finished with the image gallery. What's left is optimize it for mobile devices. 

**Thoughts**: Feel happy to start Round 2. For this round, I plan to continue with freeCodeCamp's curriculum plus other **free** online sources to reinforce my skill (like Algorithm and Data Structure). And I aim contribute more to open sources projects, or at least do my own projects.
